UTF-8, which stands for Unicode Transformation Format, 8-bit, is a character encoding standard used to represent text in computing systems. It is designed to encode characters from the Unicode character set, which encompasses a vast array of characters from various writing systems around the world.

UTF-8 is widely used in computing, particularly on the internet, because it offers several key advantages. Firstly, it is backward-compatible with ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), meaning that ASCII characters are represented using the same encoding in UTF-8. This compatibility ensures that existing ASCII-based systems can seamlessly transition to UTF-8 without any issues.

Additionally, UTF-8 is space-efficient and versatile. It uses a variable-length encoding scheme, where different characters are represented using different numbers of bytes. This allows UTF-8 to be efficient for encoding text that primarily consists of ASCII characters, while still supporting characters from other languages and special symbols. As a result, UTF-8 can represent a wide range of characters while remaining efficient in terms of storage and transmission.

Overall, UTF-8 has become the dominant character encoding standard for the web and computing systems due to its compatibility, efficiency, and support for a diverse range of languages and writing systems. It enables applications and websites to handle multilingual content seamlessly, facilitating global communication and information exchange.
